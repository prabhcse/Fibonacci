Fibonacci
=========

To attain the highest fibonacci number in 30 mins.

I had used number creation using linked list, and the number system to be used can be changed.
So the addition of numbers (build from digits which are in turn build from Linked List) has been manually done.

It gives the accurate value of fibonacci number not an approximation, using the classic F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).
It is an iterative process.

Prabh.
